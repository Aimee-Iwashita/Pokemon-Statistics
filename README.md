This report explores and analyzes Pokémon statistics using SQL and R. The analysis focuses on identifying the top Pokémon for each stat (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, HP, Speed, and Total) and examining the difference between the total stats of legendary and non-legendary Pokémon using bootstrapping. Furthermore, a heatmap is created to reveal patterns in type combinations. The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle
